## Portfolio Website
My portfolio website is a react app that works with Bootstrap and React-Indiana-Drag-Scroll among other things.

## Features to add / Bugs to fix
- Contact Form 
- If a Project is clicked, it should slide in Focus so you can see the whole Container
- Tablet Size disables scroll, but doesn't show all the Content
